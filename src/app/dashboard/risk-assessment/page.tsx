          Non communicable Diseases (NCDs) are chronic conditions that are not
          transmitted from person to person, such as diabetes, cardiovascular
          disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases.

        <p>
          This screening page is designed for use in pharmacies and hospitals to
          assess a patientâ€™s risk of developing NCDs over a 2 year period, using
          vital signs, family history, personal lifestyle and screening
          responses to provide a comprehensive risk assessment.
